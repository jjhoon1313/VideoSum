# Tensorflow version of Video_Summarization_using_Deep_Semantic_Features(by Otani Mayu et al.)
#
# Run mVGGnet.py to train the model 
#
# Run demo.py to summarize the video
#
# You need to download MSR-VTT dataset to train this DSF model.
#
# This is not the perfect version
#
# Some files to measure the summarization score(like F-measure) will be updated soon
